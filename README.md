### Estimation Feature - work in progress
 - We will provide a framework for the teams to perform time and resource allocation on any ticket or feature that a development team is working on
 - We have taken various data from JIRA projects perform deep learning on that to determine, how much time a particular feature takes to complete
 - For instance a feature like authentication has already been implemented earlier in some project in this industry, so on that bases we can predict how much time
 this feature will take , this time will work as a reference to the developer and the Project Manager/Scrum Master/Agile Coach.
 - It will help the client to have a better and rational understanding of a story.
 - It will help the leadership group in managing resources in a project,

### Use Case
- The user can ask queries through chat/voice-to-text conversion and will get appropriate text-to-voice/chat response from IPM.
